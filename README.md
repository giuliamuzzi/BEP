# BEP â€“ Bachelor's End Project
This repository contains the code notebook for my Bachelor's End Project (BEP) in Applied Mathematics at TU/e Eindhoven.
# Project Title
Propagation of Uncertainty in Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations
# Project Summary
This project investigates how uncertainty in the initial conditions of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) propagates through time. 
Key objectives:
- Model uncertainty in initial conditions using unimodal and bimodal Gaussian distributions.
- Implement pushforward methods: Particle method adn Gaussian Mixture Model.
- Compare these approximation methods using Wasserstein-2 distance metric.
